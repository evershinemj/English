in the course of several decades
the most arresting question I have ever fielded
ingenuous tone
genuinely curious
mustered a reasonably creditable answer
embellished, to be sure, by the distortions of memorys
as a sentient being
refine your faculty of reason
the natural and cultural world
perpetuating itself
perpetuate life
have the gall to
arcane
dubious
