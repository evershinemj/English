They got together.
They're flirting.
They're seeing each other.

She wasn't very fastidious about personal hygiene.
There is no escaping the fact that...
Its population exploded
Drastic measures are called for.
Tears clogged her throat.
I'm lost for words.
I think time will tell.
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Could you be more specific?
I'd just like to confirm that I got that right.
I think you are saying...
Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Let me start that again.
Let me start over.
I don't buy that.
Let's not beat around the bush.
Be they in captivity, or in the wild.
we got some uh...
who is it?
Not very.
Would you care for some tea?
I'm craving something to eat.
I don't care for your opinion.
I care about you a great deal.
I love the sight of you.
She's attracted to fast cars.
He doesn't find his job very appealing.
It's a hard habit to break.
That's exactly right.
What's the climate like in your country?
I hope we win the tournament this year.
I hope so too.
I hope she feels better.
He's the best hope for the team.
I keep hoping that things will get better.
I wish it would stop raining.
I hope it will be fine tomorrow.
I'm afraid it will rain again.
If she goes, I go.
Sounds like fun.
Good for you!
Break a leg!
Please take your seats.
She's a tough act to follow.
What do you think of it?
How about a rain check?
I suspect that ...
I would suggest ...
This old house is falling apart.
Go one block and take a left.
It's not my day today.
Does he have a temperature?
This is better than expected.
Kitty, twelve o'clock.
Really? No way!
No, I'm OK.
No, I'm good.
I'm cool.
What do you think of that idea?
What would be your advice?
What would you do in my shoes?
Let me give you a bit of advice.
I'd recommend that you try to relax.
My advice would be to go home.
I sincerely appreciate it.
What's the rush?
I wouldn't trade it for a trip to the moon.
Many dangers await them.
He was in a critical condition and needed intensive care.
I wish you nothing but the best.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

Are you a man or a mouse?
I'm gonna pass.
Look on the bright side.
No way. Not a chance.
Easy does it.
My heart is racing.
Keep my fingers crossed.
Look before you leap.
Have a good one.
I will not stand for this.
I just want to get this mess straightened out.
This is intolerable.
I've had it up to here with this guy.
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.
I want to make a complaint.
Nobody's buying.
This campaign just got dirty.
Nobody home, huh?
Just you and me, huh?
I gotta break free.
I got this batter almost done.
It's worth every penny of it.
I can't decide yet.
Price cuts failed to boost sales.   
Please give him my regards.
I've been watching what I eat.
It's about time.
It's about time I came clean and admitted it.
Come see me sometime.

It may be worth your while.
Check back in a jiffy.
I'll go get a latte.
Can I make one small request?
You're requested to be in court next week.
Could you move over a little bit?
Could you give me a hand with this box?
It's gonna be hideous.
I don't see it.
Having said that, ...
Are you up for some tennis today?
Let's go out for a bite.
I was terrified.
I presume you'll be back tomorrow.
I assume you'll be back tomorrow?
I have to make a difficult choice.

Good luck with ...
No running in the halls, please.
I was shaking from head to toe.
I am truly in heaven now.
If not, ...
Fares, please!

I couldn't say for definite.
I couldn't say absolutely.
I'm certain of it.
I'm positive that he did it.
Give me a little credit.
Super pumped to be here.
We gotta hustle.
She slurped her coffee.
I don't like to meddle.
Nothing's lacking here.

What purpose does it serve?

Not to worry.
What about you?
She slammed the door in my face.
As delighted as I am, ...
Let's get this thing over with.
What could possibly go wrong.
Go over there.
Come over here.
Plot those points on your graph.
A little fun ain't gonna kill you.
Maybe I'm too tough on him.
Maybe I should get going.
I really didn't mean to intrude.
Not that I know of.
That's the spirit!
I think she's gonna pull it off today.
Be that as it may, ...
The car's packed.
Why is it that ...

This is just my opinion, but ...
Sometimes, we fellows gotta wing it.

No entry.
Why not give it a try?
I'm coming down with a toothache.
The bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit.
I need some time to think about where our relationship is heading.

I have a hunch that ...
That is not cool with me.
Why are you acting so irritated?
If it's not anything extravagant, I'll buy it for you.

The table is set.
We're running low on wine. Is there any left in the cellar?
He picked the thorn from his leg with sedulous care.
The blaze is spreading quickly. We need to evacuate these people!
I'm sorry I haven't called or anything.
That single sensation is all I remember.
Forget about it and move on.
We're down in the weeds here with customer service.
What are friends for?
I didn't have the nerve to tell you then.
Guess who I was talking to? -- Your shrink? 
Why don't you go to sleep and have a good night's rest?
You're as human as the rest of us, if not more so.
This is a reception area, not a waiting room.
So inexperienced, you're such a chump.
You're putting your job on the line.
Is that plain enough?
Fill me in. Let me learn from you.
They're gonna buy it.
You're out of mind.

I slipped.
For your information, ...
Don't lose your cool.
We have the phones tapped.
Not even close.
Let's just give our best shot.
Give me a break.
She did not requite his love.
They are quick to requite a kindness.
The favor was reciprocated.
Nice shot!
Variety is the spice of life.
What have you got in mind?
What do you have in mind?
Can you believe how much a bag of popcorn costs at the theater.
We've got a few minutes before the start of movie.
This theater is packed tonight.
The plot wasn't very realistic.
I think this scene is filmed in my hometown.
Are there any movies you want to see in case this one is sold out?
I think my seat is near the aisle.
Let's go find our seats.
This movie was based on a true story.
What time does the show start?
The director seemed to rely mostly on special effects.
There's one out now about a talking horse.
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

Meant a lot to me.
I owe you an apology.
How shall I atone for my mistakes?
I'd like to see you, if that wouldn't be too much of an imposition.
It's not we're going out or anything.
I'm dead serious. I don't need to think this over.
She is expecting.
The cat's out of the bag.
I can't believe she fell for it. She is a lot more gullible than I thought.
She won't fall for that trick.
Her obsessive behavior includes relentless tidying.
She's an incorrigible flirt.
He might seem like a nice guy, but don't fall for it. He's a jerk.
I had no sooner got to the kitchen than the doorbell rang loud enough to wake the dead.

Do you have a history of heart trouble?
The pain is mostly in my lower back.
I'm on a debate team.
What is going on in here?

I cannot stress this strongly enough.
Long story.
It's arrogant to presume animals to be insentient.

Anchor the boat for a little while. I'm gonna take a dip.

We got tents set up at the backyard.
Oh man, I really didn't think this through.

The noise is getting on my nerves.
Watch your step.
May I take your name?
He will be here momentarily.
Right this way.
I'll show you to her office.
What am I doing wrong?
That jerk came into the picture.
She got knocked up.
June should have got her exam results by now and know that she's passed, knock on wood.
He had made a detour to a cafe.
Get over it.
I didn't use to.
I put it in there.
Spend time with friends, and share your grief and heartbreak.
It used not to be like that.
Did she use to come here?
It didn't use to be like that.
Timing is an important factor.
The team had a close call in the preliminary group games.
Her presence puts a damper on our fun.
Wouldn't miss it for the world!
We're all crazy about ice cream in the summer.
What a nut!
I can't take it any more.
He snores just like a pig.
They're offering a two-for-one special.
You're leaving me no choice.
This is so not the mall.
What's that supposed to mean?
We're gonna get even (with ...).
I don't get you.
This is killing me.
That would be helpful, wouldn't it?
Perfect timing.
No, not a chance.
I can relate.
My heart's gonna beat out of my chest.
You're going out of your way to help me.
By the end of the day I was a nervous wreck.
How do you want your steak cooked?
What's your special today?
His prospects are promising.
Come in, lad, and shut the door.
His coffee was just to his liking.
Winter was coming on.
I think I just need a trim.
Do you want a perm?
Would you like a quick shampoo and rinse?
Should I taper the back?
How about a shampoo?
The impact of the dollar's depreciation started to taper off.
You're off by a mile.
He was offside by a mile.
The bullet was deflected harmlessly into the ceiling.
He attempted to deflect attention away from his private life.
No question about it.
The well-behaved and I are natural enemies.
I'm running low on ...
Love knows no age.
Your words say one thing, but your eyes say another.
I'm as lonely as lonely can be.
We were over the worst.
Your wedding day is the one time that you can live out your most romantic fantasies.
I'm sure you're going to be a big hit.
Are you stupid or what?
Starting is half the battle.
The car alarm is going off.
It's a bummer.
I was terrified.
The bell went off.
You'll be hearing from me soon.
I need to file a missing person's report.
That area is out of our jurisdiction.
Nice weather, huh?
It's been a while.
It's getting on my nerves.
Try turning your head toward me.
I just need a room for two.
Do you have any vacancies?
I'd like wake-up call.
Do you want a single or double bed?

Don't stretch yourself too thin.
He's cheap.
Keep the change.
Where to, sir?
Thailand is a great place to go sightseeing.
I'm kind of strapped for time.
You can't miss it.
It's taking forever.
You done yet?
You'll be lodging elsewhere.
Don't you think I would if I could?
So what's the big emergency?
What an awesome view!
Kinda.
I'm blown away by his new poem.
Fancy meeting you here!
Sales have gone way up this month.
You haven't made a single sale in the past 3 weeks.
I'm positively famished.
Chill out, man. It's not a big problem.
Their emergency rations ran out.
I got a bunch of errands to run.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
I found this flyer with your address on it.
It's the thought that counts.
Snuff the candles before you leave.
A breeze snuffed out the candle.
It was really a close call.
I have to run an errand.
Should that occur, ...
Don't be a pushover. Stand up for yourself.
He's such a pushover when it comes to women.
That bus is too crowded to board.
The exhaust fumes are choking me.
My hand is swelling up.
Delving into the body's secrets, I looked death in the face, so to speak.
He is a Spaniard.
He is Spanish.
Betty bettered her performance by studying harder.
He's a good command of English.
He had a brilliant command of English.
I'm on the edge of collapse.
I feel like I'm gonna explode.
I'll have to look at the specs on the equipment.
The car was towed back to the garage.
It was a close one.
Boarding will begin in about 30 minutes.
When does your flight land?
We have half an hour to go before the end of the day.
He jammed on the brakes and spun out.
I'm joined by my partner in crime.
You can't park here or the car will be towed by the police.
I'll need your assistance.
Like how?
Am I cramping your style?
Your shouldn't act so immature.
She looked the epitome of elegance and good taste.
I'm coming clean.
Are you a complete moron?
You're not supposed to run in the hallway.
Upstairs. On the right.
I can explain.
You're five minutes past curfew.
We're strapped for time.
Piss off!
Are you in or out?
My girlfriend almost found the present I hid under the bed. It was a close one.
Working conditions were appalling.
Eight hours constitute a legal day's work.
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.
Don't be too hard on us.
It's just getting on my nerves.
Together, We can tackle whatever life throws at us.
What a nutjob!
You always get angry over nothing. You have such a bad temper.
Not a day has gone by that I haven't wished here.
Not a second has gone by that I haven't missed you.
A crime has been perpetrated against a sovereign state.
They perpetrated a series of armed robberies.
Why's that?
She doesn't seem to be acting any differently.
I think of it as a career rather than a vocation.
You're particularly odd today.
Any preference?
I need props.
You scared the life out of me!
You need to hone your communication skills.
She has taken numerous workshops to hone her skills over the years.
Snow lay thick on the ground.
The rains come in September. 
That roller coaster terrified me.

What seems to be the problem?
I finally broke free from that awful relationship.
We tied up the dog, but he's trying to break free.
I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities.
She would have to be circumspect in her dealings with Catherine.
I'm heading out so you'll be in charge. Keep an eye on things here for me.
I'd rather not wake her up.
Even best friends can't expect to see eye to eye on everything.
I'll sum it up for you.
He and I do not always see eye to eye.
Yuriko saw eye to eye with Yul on almost every aspect of the production.
Local feeling does not necessarily concur with the press.
She has been working hard to hone her physique.
I suspect her of being a kidnapper.
I see eye to eye with you on this one.
What the heck is going on?
Intelligence agencies intercepted a series of telephone calls.
He lived up to my expectations.
I give you my word.
My muscles feel numb.
It's never good to put such a high value on appearances.
How often do you work out?
His unhappiness would weigh on my mind so much.
She weighed her options.
It's not his day today.
He is weighing the possibility of filing criminal charges against the doctor.
You must weigh up the pros and cons.
I weighed the benefits of the plan against the risks involved.
Out of fear, she submitted to Jim's emotional blackmail.
Three armed men hijacked a white van.
It's barely even begun.
The memory was so painful that he obliterated it from his mind.
Clouds were darkening, obliterating the sun.
Think of the ramifications.
An elaborate system of canals was built, ramifying throughout Britain.
Any change is bound to have legal ramifications.
Let's catch up later.
I'm coming down with something. Nothing serious, though.
Take it or leave it.
End of story.
The staff are extremely supportive of each other.
She's one of a kind.
A promise is a promise.
What seems to be bothering you?
What seems to be troubling you?
What seems to be the matter?
He stood me up. -- What a lousy guy!
I saw a lousy movie last weekend.
If I stand my girlfriend up just once, she'll dump me straight away.
I can't put up with her nagging.
Don't be so damn silly!
What do you think you would have done with the money if you hadn't bought the book?
She's majorly hot.
They go by many names.
That referee is blind.
I think he was out of bounds.
He's playing too rough.
Get lost!
Get lost before I change my mind.
You look fabulous.

I'm gonna make it up to you.
Get lost now.

A lot of people confuse a stroke with a heart attack.
Purchasers might confuse the two products.
The people are scrambling to buy the tickets for the concert.
The pitcher winds up.
The players are scrambling to get the ball.
This puts the team ahead by two.
You're up to bat.
You really hit a home run.
I woke up late today and had to scramble to work as fast as possible.
It's so bright and airy.
Can you gift-wrap this book?
Lights were blazing.
When push came to shove, I always stood up for him.
He was cocooned in the university.
I can't take it any more.
I have to work overtime.
They were working overtime to fulfill a big order.
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.
The board has the power to arbitrate in disputes.
It set up a commission to arbitrate border tensions.
A third and disinterested party was brought in to arbitrate.
Your bruise is healing.
She was expelled from school.
You need to loosen up.
That's a bit odd.
He was new to the game but had a few tricks up his sleeve.
Before long there will be no turning back.
I'm amazed you find the time, not to mention the energy, to do any work at all.
He was incapable of leading a bowling team, let alone a country.
She had no sooner spoken than the telephone rang.
Save your breath.
Go straight ahead.
Nuke it.
Vampires are unique in that they are immortal.
Resolution of the conflict was contingent on the signing of a ceasefire agreement.
Perfect timing.
I think he has a bit of a thing for you.
What's he been up to?
Are you willing to give me a shot?
Are we really getting a snowstorm, or are you pulling my leg?
That's more like you.
You have a curfew. How old are you?
Not really my thing.
It's getting in the way of my life.
I haven't been completely honest with you.
I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.
There's a lot of hoopla about the movie.
The party was a blast.
We had a blast at the party.
Cool it!
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Who are you to play God with our fate?
I'm swell.
That was a swell party.
Just cool it!
You need to cool it and stop yelling at me.
It will be a blast!
I had a great time last night. It was a blast!
She told him the gory details of her past.
Nothing could dampen her enthusiasm.
I've been meaning to apologize.
How exactly?
This emergency supersedes our argument.
You did not just hang up on me!
You're barred from campus.
It contains a mild anesthetic to soothe the pain.
Are you mental?
Don't you take that tone with me.
My shift is over in fifty minutes.
It is your belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.
That's not a role I want to take on.
Don't be coy.
At least I didn't trip.
You're not obligated to help me.
The lights are busted.
What's up? -- Well, nothing special.
That's good slang.
How else can you ...
I'll go talk to him and straighten this out.
Great play!
The guy is a powerhouse. He can lift five hundred pounds.
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape.
It's killer.
I didn't receive the documents on time, thus I was unable to send them to you.
The causes are manifold.
Food is scarce and more often than not they go hungry.
Does your job pay well?
What are you running away like that for?
Public opinion turned against him.
I need a minute to collect myself.
He was characteristically calm and matter-of-fact.
Warmth emanated from the fireplace.
She felt an undeniable charm emanating from him.
It's five blocks away and it's got everything.
She tapped on the door.
Didn't mean to spoil the mood.
Misery loves company.
We need to tap the expertise of the people we already have.
The movie seems to tap into a general sentimentality about animals. 
I hate Brian for what he put me through.
He'd subjected her to a terrifying ordeal.
I told her not cool. She backed off.
I heard the sirens.
I couldn't come empty-handed.
My imagination runs wild.
She exercised compulsively.
My name's right there in the credits.
She was hoping for some reciprocal comment or gesture.
I haven't seen you in ages.
He completely lost it.
I really dig heavy rock.
I'll crash in the back of the van for a couple of hours.
Are you ok here by yourself?
I dig it, man.
You did what I'm saying?
I really like your pad.
Thank you for having me crash here tonight.
Confront the girl.
The rumor was ...
It's not the first time her husband has cheated.
I'm gonna fix myself a drink.
So you had a rough day?
My secretary called in sick.
I had the hell of a day.
I got a new hairdo.
I don't expect you to be chic or stylish.
Not in the slightest.
Sometimes old dogs need new tricks.
She plied me with chocolate chip cookies.
Duty calls.
Are you sulking?
Don't wait up.
I'm sick of you prying into my personal life.
Why are you even doing this?
I gasped and stared and babbled, “Look at this!”
He began to babble an apology.
There's no way you're gonna survive. Not if you stand there and take it head-on.
You strike me as unnaturally relaxed.
You've got guts.
I'm thinking of ...
What on earth for?
Live and let live.
I'm afraid so.
Need to drop by the dry-cleaner's.
Why are you trying so hard to hold on to me?
That will cost a fortune.
I don't want your tuna to spoil.
He puts up with extravagance and my nonsense.
Took forever.

It's rumored that he lives on a houseboat.
It happened that ...
You haven't aged a day.
You skin ages quicker when exposed to direct sunlight.
We're calling for scattered showers for today.
The forecast calls for snow flurries tonight.
A cold front is moving in.
The movie is linear.
I think otherwise.
I rather suspect we're making a mistake.
We were rather hoping you might do that for us.
If you don't mind me saying so.
What about yourself?
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but ...
The main electricity supply had been sabotaged by the rebels.
Protesters failed to sabotage the peace talks.
My husband didn't care for my play.
The purpose of an autopsy is to provide clarity.
He canceled on me.
Lower your voice.
“Oh, for God's sake!” snarled Dyson.
Since when?
We were just about to send out the search party.
Do you expect me to buy your story?
I am not prepared to buy the claim that the ends justify the means.
I don't know if you're seeing someone these days.
I'm a well-known philanthropist. -- I don't need to know your specialty.
They were busted for drugs.
We don't need to throw more gas on that fire.
You're busted.
Drop the subject.
Not even close.
I used to covet things like this.
Haven't even crossed her mind.
I swerved to avoid a kitten.
I have a hunch ...
They just ate your pizza and drank your soda and booked.
I need to mellow out, I need to calm down.
Let's grab some grub.
I have an employee who is always hitting me up for a raise.
How's it hanging?
Let's go down to the beach and mellow out.
Good heavens!
Great timing.
I don't know what's got into him.
What's got into you?
We're not done talking.
His emotions are running high.
It's definitely worth every cent I paid for.
You wanna book and go grab some grub?
The media referenced our association in almost 40 articles.
Wealth is a means and not an end in itself.
You're full of it.
There's no need to blab the whole story.
Who would have thought that possible not so very long ago?
I think him nice.
Superficially, they have little in common.
The lid snapped shut.
His eyes snapped open.
You wanna make sure your boots fit snugly.
Skip to what sucks.
Maybe there's more to me than meets the eye.
She never got my jokes.
To start the ball rolling, the government was asked to contribute a million dollars to the fund.
Hold your horses.
We can't tell you how thrilled we are.
These guidelines have worked for me, perhaps they can save you some time and effort.
We got a little carried away.
Anything in life that is dear to us is worth so much because of the time and effort we put into acquiring it.
Any objections?
Just my luck.
Spit it out, will you?
Spit it out, man, I haven't got all day.
I don't see anything wrong with it.
It was quite the presentation.
Marie tried to assimilate the week's events.
Pop trends are assimilated into the mainstream with alarming speed.
We've got to take accusations of sexism on board.
And that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.
Where is this going?
I assumed as much.
Certainly a lot to catch up on.
I just thought he'd be man enough to tell it in my face.
She spends money like there's no tomorrow.
I'm feeling under the weather.
Let's hit the road.
My ears and I are just leaving.
There's no one else I can turn to.
I think he'll be thrilled.
What do I do? -- Come clean.
You turned the situation into your advantage.
You're going to rehab first thing in the morning.
Why the long face?
I'll be taking over now.
I like connecting with people.
I taught in a reading program and I connected with kids individually.
That's my main focus.
In his eagerness to court Sally, he embarrassed her.
What a shame!
It's a shame that ...
Every time Sue sees Nick, her eyes sparkle.
I'm tweaking my resume. What about this font instead?
The foie gras for the lady and the mushroom soup for you.
Why are you making such a big deal?
Why do you have to take everything so personally, for crying out loud?
It costs a fortune.
I got offered a new job.
He never allowed his love of Australia to blind him to his countrymen's faults.
This is private land, so beat it!
I tried to reason with her, but without success.
Had she been using again?
If you'll just bear with us, I'm sure the lights will be back on soon
It was a sick party and there were tons of cool people there.
Stop sulking.
He will be good as new in no time.
I'll set the table.
A phone call from you know who.
I stormed into his office and blurted it out.
I have some errands I need to run.
Let me make it up to you.
I can't just blow him off.
Are you in love with him, by any chance?
For crying out loud, worst possible answer.
Their relationship hit rock bottom.
Prices hit rock bottom.
The marriage had reached rock bottom.
Morale is at rock bottom.
Lay it on me.
The company had filed for bankruptcy.
The profits are falling fast.
We're doomed.
I got up and dressed on automatic pilot. 
Don't be too hard on yourself. Give yourself some credit.
What's ... all about (anyway)?
This summer is eventful, to say the least.
My ability hasn't lessened.
Sorry to barge in on your cozy evening.
Poor nutrition can leave you feeling below par.
Which other animal can compare to the dog?
Damn it! Nothing's going my way tonight!
Only ten seconds left to go.
The illness is difficult to overcome, but we hope she'll pull through.
Square-footage?
We read up on you.
Life is inherently risky.
You guessed it.
The deal will pull through.
Sorry, I'm running late.
The filming ran over schedule and budget.
The meeting ran over by fifteen minutes.
She says she got tied up with a client.
She would be tied up at the meeting all day.
The traffic began to back up.
I've been meaning to ...
The traffic was backed up a couple of miles in each direction.
Going abroad is a rich experience.
Dude, don't have a cow!
Sophie makes wicked cakes.
Too bad the driver is a major dweeb.
You totally fell for it.
We'll see who has the last laugh.
She thinks I am pining away from love.
I'm pining for my girlfriend.
I'm kind of worn out.
We've been tracking the intruders' whereabouts.
I've got an errand to run, so I can't hang out with you.
Anywhere too expensive or too long a line is out.
I don't know what this commotion is about, but anyone messing with a friend of mine can't get away with it.
I'm dead beat.
You get paid to five, you work to five, no later.
He raised his glass in a toast.
One suspect in custody.
Losses amounted to over 10 million dollars.
Their actions amounted to a conspiracy.
The idea just doesn't compute.
The costs mount up when you buy a home.
His anxiety mounted as messages were left unanswered.
Feeling the blush mount in her cheeks, she looked down quickly.
He's a player who rarely seems to get the credit he deserves.
I can't take all the credit for the show's success—it was a team effort.
We did all the work and she gets all the credit!
Credit will be given in the exam for good spelling and grammar. 
At least give him credit for trying.
Vandalism used to be a rare occurrence.
The resources were to be tapped for our benefit.
Things got a little out of hand.
My head has been pounding all day.
Tell me about it.
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water.
We hit a diner for coffee and doughnuts.
I threw up like five times.
You've got a lot on your plate at the moment.
An excuse like that is tantamount to lying.
I'm not trying to pass the buck here.
No more phony excuses.
We're off the main road.
