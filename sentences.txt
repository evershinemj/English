I could have a nibble
I'm famished.
I fancy some food.
I've got a craving for ...
Sorry?
I didn't quite catch that.
I missed that.
Did you get to see ...
(I'm) Not fussed.
(I'm) Not bothered.
Fair enough.
(I) suppose so.
Might as well.
It can be seen from space.
The day breaks.
The night falls.
The clock is ticking.
She sets them up.
She sets him up with her.
They are hitting it off.
She's the third wheel.
They're making out.
They got together.
They're flirting.
They're seeing each other.
They're having a tiff.
The sun is relentless.
It's agility versus power.
So far, so good.

The sidewalks are bustling with people. 
It's imperative that...
temperatures rarely rise above freezing, and the air is very thin
She wasn't very fastidious about personal hygiene.
There is no escaping the fact that...
Its population exploded
Drastic measures are called for.
Tears clogged her throat.
I'm lost for words.
I think time will tell.
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Could you be more specific?
I'd just like to confirm that I got that right.
I think you are saying...
Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Let me start that again.
Let me start over.
I don't buy that.
Let's not beat around the bush.
Be they in captivity, or in the wild.
we got some uh...
who is it?
Not very.
Would you care for some tea?
I'm craving something to eat.
I don't care for your opinion.
I care about you a great deal.
I love the sight of you.
She's attracted to fast cars.
He doesn't find his job very appealing.
It's a hard habit to break.
That's exactly right.
What's the climate like in your country?
I hope we win the tournament this year.
I hope so too.
I hope she feels better.
He's the best hope for the team.
I keep hoping that things will get better.
I wish it would stop raining.
I hope it will be fine tomorrow.
I'm afraid it will rain again.
If she goes, I go.
Sounds like fun.
Good for you!
Break a leg!
Please take your seats.
She's a tough act to follow.
What do you think of it?
How about a rain check?
I suspect that ...
I would suggest ...
This old house is falling apart.
Go one block and take a left.
It's not my day today.
Does he have a temperature?
This is better than expected.
Kitty, twelve o'clock.
Really? No way!
No, I'm OK.
No, I'm good.
I'm cool.
What do you think of that idea?
What would be your advice?
What would you do in my shoes?
Let me give you a bit of advice.
I'd recommend that you try to relax.
My advice would be to go home.
I sincerely appreciate it.
What's the rush?
I wouldn't trade it for a trip to the moon.
Many dangers await them.
He was in a critical condition and needed intensive care.
I wish you nothing but the best.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
There was no one around.
He would want to have her around as much as possible.
Are you a man or a mouse?
I'm gonna pass.
Look on the bright side.
No way. Not a chance.
Easy does it.
My heart is racing.
Keep my fingers crossed.
Look before you leap.
Have a good one.
I will not stand for this.
I just want to get this mess straightened out.
This is intolerable.
I've had it up to here with this guy.
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.
I want to make a complaint.
Nobody's buying.
This campaign just got dirty.
Nobody home, huh?
Just you and me, huh?
I gotta break free.
I got this batter almost done.
It's worth every penny of it.
I can't decide yet.
Price cuts failed to boost sales.   
Please give him my regards.
I've been watching what I eat.
It's about time.
It's about time I came clean and admitted it.
Come see me sometime.
As cute as it is, ...
Keep it up.
Knock it off.
Don't blow this opportunity.
What was your name again?
You're next on deck.
It may be worth your while.
Check back in a jiffy.
I'll go get a latte.
Can I make one small request?
You're requested to be in court next week.
Could you move over a little bit?
Could you give me a hand with this box?
It's gonna be hideous.
I don't see it.
Having said that, ...
Are you up for some tennis today?
Let's go out for a bite.
I was terrified.
I presume you'll be back tomorrow.
I assume you'll be back tomorrow?
I have to make a difficult choice.
Everything is going according to plan.
The disaster was a result of poor planning.
I'll keep thinking about it.
Get off my back!
You're like the clumsiest kid I know.
Good luck with ...
No running in the halls, please.
I was shaking from head to toe.
I am truly in heaven now.
If not, ...
Fares, please!
I couldn't say for sure.
I couldn't say for definite.
I couldn't say absolutely.
I'm certain of it.
I'm positive that he did it.
Give me a little credit.
Super pumped to be here.
We gotta hustle.
She slurped her coffee.
I don't like to meddle.
Nothing's lacking here.
I clung to the tree for dear life.
Are you being waited on?
What a nuisance!
Let's see.
I'm glad we see eye to eye.
I'll go along with that.
I'll go along with you on this one.
I was hoping to ...
He worked by feel rather than using his eyes.
The cheese is firm in texture.
What purpose does it serve?
The timing is just not right.
I'll take your words for it.
I'm sure he'll find a way to do it without more taxes.
I have faith in the government.
Not to worry.
What about you?
She slammed the door in my face.
As delighted as I am, ...
Let's get this thing over with.
What could possibly go wrong.
Go over there.
Come over here.
Plot those points on your graph.
A little fun ain't gonna kill you.
Maybe I'm too tough on him.
Maybe I should get going.
I really didn't mean to intrude.
Not that I know of.
That's the spirit!
I think she's gonna pull it off today.
Be that as it may, ...
The car's packed.
Why is it that ...
Business has really picked up.
You're the best in the business.

Look at the bright side.
Let's catch up soon.
Put simply, ...
Catch you later!
I'll just get changed.
It's not that ...
You're too chicken to face the facts.
Most of all, ...
The government decreed that ...
It blew my mind.

Don't push it.
The scientists do concede that weather prediction has many uncertainties.
My holidays passed quickly.
I have never been abroad before.

There's nothing to freak out about.
Sit up straight--don't slouch!
He just slouched, pretengin to work.
She's no slouch.

My bicycle has a flat tyre.
It looks kind of light.
The keys on the keyboard sometimes get stuck.
I'm curious to know ...
The logic of this eluded most people.
It's weird how such a simple expression eludes me.
Sandwiched in the middle are the sandwiches.
I didn't mean it.
You look sick or something?
I make you remember things better left forgotten.
This is just my opinion, but ...
Sometimes, we fellows gotta wing it.
It tears me up inside.
It all comes down to wrist control.
Many expected him to melt down at the first sign of trouble.
Don't know.
Count me out.
Count me in.
You don't know what the future holds.
The product can be tweaked to suit your needs
Engineers tweak the car's operating systems during the race.

Problem solved.
This is a plan with no downside.
That's a splendid idea.
I feel terrible.
She's pretty cute, huh.
The tempo is picking up.
So be it.
They would rather die than admit it.
You're left with something beautiful.
What's that supposed to mean?

Watch your back.
My tyre is exploded.
I have an ocean of love for you.
The savings turned out to be a savior.
Nice try.
Nice try, buddy.
I don't want to rain on your parade, but ...

The water is fizzy, while my sweater is fuzzy.
I'm a bit pumped today.
I was so pumped that I overdid everything.
It's such a relief.
They have an edge over their rivals.
All or nothing.

Don't be ridiculous.
Can't believe I'm doing this.
Round to the right.
You will be charged ...
What are you?
Fashion never ceases to surprise me.
It will all come down to ...
It all comes down to working out.
You're all ready already?
If you can't get everything all right, it's still alright.
I haven't seen you in a while, let's talk awhile.
You rock!
It's very crisp and cool.
This morning is cooler than expected.
It's good weather for football.

She has awful taste in literature.
Sign me up.
Good point.

It's about half and half.
She enunciated each word slowly.
It doesn't taste anything like wine.
If you are anything like us, ...
He is responsible for all the stage props and lighting.

You're about to take your very first steps.
For one thing, ...
She was always humoring him to prevent trouble.
I quit.
Safety first.
Think about the positives.
Why in the world ...

No objections.
Let's all get along, OK?
She's changed her Twitter handle.
And then come the hoards.
My fingers are crossed for you.
I'm a living example of that.
No entry.
Why not give it a try?
I'm coming down with a toothache.
The bottom line is I don't think he's a good fit.
I need some time to think about where our relationship is heading.
You didn't even have the decency to call me.
I'm not going to take any more of your empty promises.
This is the fifth time you stood me up in two weeks.
You need to get your priorities straight.

Stop being so rigid.
Good grief!
She probably won't awaken again.

I condition my hair regularly.
You've been acting weird ever since this morning.
It's been a little while.
You two are on good terms after all.
Don't lose your momentum.
I'm going to give them the piece of mind.
I have a hunch that ...
That is not cool with me.
Why are you acting so irritated?
If it's not anything extravagant, I'll buy it for you.
Better have a buck handy if you get caught at a red light in the Big Apple.
How do you like ...?
He is as bad as can be.
She is as beautiful as can be.
Today is as hot as can be.
He punched me on the back.
He punched me in the nose.
Don't be so modest.
This traffic is such a pain in the neck.
I hope you can keep up with the work.
I have to go study.
It's just my opinion, but I think it's pretty boring.

I stayed up all night studying for this test.
I'm really bored with this class.
Boxing is a rough sport.

Try me.
Fine. I'll fight this battle myself.

You too.
You've been through a lot.
How did this even happen?

It's for a good cause.
We're on the jumbo screen.
You two are so well grounded.
It's ancient history.
Sometimes I got a little carried away.
Don't act surprised.
I wonder why that is the way it is.
What cast this shadow?
It's just ludicrous.
Make your move.
If the role calls for it, you may have to shed some tears.
I guess you should start socializing more.

Please return the book when you're finished with it.
Can you give me a ride into town?
Can I offer you a glass of wine?
Can I offer you something to drink?
What about?
What's on your mind?
We're gonna give it our all.
What's the holdup?
We hope we will make history come alive for the children.
Staying here won't do us any good.
... if you ask me.
Please try not to push yourself too hard.
We promise we won't get in the way.
Truce, all right?

That's my last offer.
Are you sleeping OK? Are you eating OK?
We built up confidence in our abilities.
He cares for his children.
Don't tell me you're going to give up without a fight.

He had connections with the music industry.
Get packed.
I had it up to here.
We can't afford this upscale furniture.
