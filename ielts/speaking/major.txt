one of the reasons for this would probably be that ...
I guess I probably wouldn't say so
a relatively new major
as far as I know
which offer this course
mainly because of the huge workload we get
a considerable amount of coursework
requires a ton of background reading
actually, I wouldn't really say so
partly because ... and also because ...
go on the Internet
went through the textbooks
those classes were pretty few and far between
stand me in good stead
seeing as
our lectures are quite interactive
at least that's the way I see it
