by and large
chill out
do stuff together
head back to our dormitory
a close-knit group
we just go where our mood takes us
as well as that
the more the merrier
has more of a party feel to it
get on well with your colleagues
mutual support and respect for each other
then they also reciprocate when they have the chance to do so
