TV addict
a lot of which is surprisingly good
not like in the past when there was virtually nothing worth watching
a pretty ridiculous amount of time
quite a variety of stuff
TV series, chat shows, talent shows and dating shows
entertaining
have some company
without a doubt
simply because
on the whole
far more entertaining than
which can be quite tiresome
I don't really think there's that big a difference
much prefer
