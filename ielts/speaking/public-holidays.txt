we've got loads of them
it's hard to generalize
by and large
the younger generation
in the way Westerners would
whereas over here
take some time off
by far the most important festival in our culture
eat and drink to your hearts' content
hordes of people
flock to all the tourist spots across the country
ruin the momentum of our daily lives
chill out at home
maintain all the various customs and traditions
Just to give you an example
