but saying that
nice and quiet
waves hitting the seashore
really soothing
the sound of drilling
at the top of my list
the sound of cars hooting
quite irritating
maddening
relentless
construction or renovation work going on around me
interestingly enough
the sound of firecrackers
set off firecrackers
brings back good memories of my childhood
basically because
this trend is likely to continue into the future
