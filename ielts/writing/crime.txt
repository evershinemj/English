ex-prisoners
discourage them from breaking the law
reformed offenders
dispel any ideas that teenagers may have about criminals leading glamorous lives
indifferent to the guidance given by
ex-offender
the vivid and perhaps shocking nature of these stories
have a powerful impact
educate teenagers
severe consequences
lawbreakers
reluctant to take advice from figures of authority
I doubt that students would see teachers as credible sources of information about this topic
I fully support the view that
peope who have turned their lives around after serving a prison sentence
deter teenagers from committing crimes

There is an opinion that
young offenders
should be held accountable for
Whilst I find this viewpoint justifiable to some extent
young and mature lawbreakers
treat ... equally
may prove to have adverse effects
I can understand why
should be no deterrent to
juvenile delinquents
in place of
imposing appropriate punishments
conduct illegal actions
young perpetrators
receive lighter sentences that they deserve
an injustice to the victimes
Nevertheless, I am convinced that
be tried in a different court
have sufficient intellectual or moral capacity to understand
the outcomes of their misdeeds
trial defendants
grown-up people
when given a second chance
underage convicts
rehabilitate
should be taken into consideration
give them a fair trial
be spared of punishments
