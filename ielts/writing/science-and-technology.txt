some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it
tackle this issue
I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate
prevent, or at least mitigate, ...
governments and individuals
There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change
enact laws
carbon dioxide emissions
governments could enact laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warning
could impose "green taxes" on drivers, airline companies, and other polluters
invest in renewable energy production
solar, wind or water power
could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power
energy efficient
by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport
voting for politicians
propose to tackle climate change
furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change
the consequences will be disastrous
If, instead of taking the above measures, we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous
to give just one example

sea levels
even a moderate rise in sea levels
To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we will be able to cope with even a moderate rise in sea levels.
Millions of people would be displaced by flooding
safeguard low-lying areas
migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries
the potential for human suffering would be huge
outbreaks of disease and famine
increased homelessness and poverty
it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty
in brief
it is clear to me that
must address the problem of climate change

while this trend is beneficial to some extent, I would argue that its disadvantages are more significant
the South Pole or the Amazon rainforest
valuable experiences and unforgettable memories
acquire more knowledge about the natural habitat
Nevertheless, I believe this development has far more drawbacks
faraway natural areas
sufficiently prepared
adversely affects people's health
face the hazard of being attacked by animals
requires a large amount of investment in researching and ensuring the safety of travelers
the costs of travelling tend to be high

The improvements in technology currently bring about negative effects on the environment.

While some people believe that having simpler lives is the only solution, I would argue that technological advances can help to tackle these environmental problems.
It is argued that
walk or cycle rather than drive cars
causes high levels of
exhaust fumes
a serious concern
which causes high levels of exhaust fumes and makes air pollution a serious concern
natural resources
fossil fuels
can be minimized
exploitation of natural resources such as fossil fuels or nuclear power can be minimized
Nevertheless, I would argue that
environmental protection
waste disposal
recycle materials such as paper or glass, which reduces the problem of waste disposal
renewable resources
create electricity using renewable resources
utilize solar energy
generate power
have built plants that utilize solar energy to generate power
non-renewable resources
it is not necessary to depend on non-renewable resources
prevent environmental issues
can be dealt with by
