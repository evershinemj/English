highlight a flooding problem
outline two possible solutions
The three diagrams highlight a flooding problem in a UK town, and outline two possible solutions to this problem
less costly
the other proposal
less damaging to the environment
where two rivers join to form one
residential housing
relocate the affected development
the downside of this is that
the upside is that
it would result in less environmental damage
a much cheaper option
would result in more being taken up by the resulting reservoirs behind the dams, thus leading to more environmental damage.

The three diagrams illustrate what the village of ... looked like in ..., ... and ...
a large expanse of
four plots of farmland
a large expanse of woods in the eastern part of the village and four plots of farmland in the middle
a river running from north to south
in the west, there was a river running from north to south

the year ... saw a doubling of the number of homes, but the size of farmland and woods was reduced by half
in the same year
residences
a road was constructed linking the river to the residences
farms and woods completely disappeared
several school buildings and sports facilities were constructed at the south-eastern corn of the village, which were connected with the residential area in the north by a newly-built road
some shops opened up along the river bank
a large stretch of
a large stretch of wetland for birds was established at the southern end of the river

The two diagrams compare the existing floor plan of a TV center with its floor plan 10 years ago.
in the old plan
a small stretch of woods in the east
a car park along the south
the remaining area was the indoor working area, which was separated by two crossed corridors into four sections
further east
across the corridor were the studio and its neighboring facilities (a make-up room, a scenery store, an office, and a furniture store).
Opposite these, to the south, were the waiting area, a canteen, two additional offices, and a costume store.
the new plan shows that the area of woods is now completely removed so that the car park has been extended along the east edge
not only is the old studio enlarged, but also there is a new one, replacing the old north office
making room for a much bigger canteen
the other rooms remain unchanged, except that there are now four dressing rooms instead of two
