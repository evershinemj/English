* bake, roast, toast
  The difference between baking and toasting is that with baking you are cooking something from its raw form. With toasting, you are adding color to an already cooked item. Roasting and broiling involve the use of fat on the surface of the food. The difference between roasting and broiling is the source of the heat.

* imply, implicate
  Imply means the hidden meaning within a sentence. For example if your mother looks at you and says 'The dishes are not going to wash themselves!' she is *implying* that you need to do the dishes.
  Implicate means to make a person responsible (usually guilty). It is often used in legal situations.
  'The fingerprints on the weapon implicate you as the murderer!'

* irony, satire, sarcasm
  To distinguish irony from satire and sarcasm, remember that irony pertains to situations while satire and sarcasm are forms of expression. People make satire and sarcasm happen. Irony is just there.
